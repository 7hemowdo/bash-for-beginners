find command => can use to search file in linux system e.g => find the list of files end with .txt or any extension 
"find . -name "*.txt"

-> wereis bash -> can be also use to find file .. this will also provide 
the location file ..

will show the executable file .. only

-> which -> is also a command to find executable file 
e.g -> which bash # this will show the eecutable file ..
