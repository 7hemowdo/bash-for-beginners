#using search commands -> find, whereis, 
find command => can use to search file in linux system e.g => find the list of files end with .txt or any extension 
"find . -name "*.txt"

-> wereis bash -> can be also use to find file .. this will also provide 
the location file ..

-> whereis -b nameOfTheFile
will show the executable file .. only

-> which -> is also a command to find executable file 
e.g -> which bash # this will show the eecutable file .. 

# using find command find a file both lower and uppercase file 
-> "find /home -iname file-name" e.g find /home -iname file.txt

# Working with directory. is much more easir working with following command

# Reading or viewing file from terminal 
cat => command is one of the commands to view file in terminal
=> with this command can also view multiple files at the same time in the terminal 
=> e.g cat file1 file2
# Head and tail command ..
These are two commands used to view files -> log file .. which give you the ability to 
view last 10 line or first 10 line in that particular file..
# to view the fist 3 line use the following command 
"head -n 4 fileName"  or 
"head fileName"
"tail fileName" display the last 10 line of any file 
"tail -n 4 fileName"diaplay the last four line of anyFile.
"more fileName" : this will allow you to view file based on size of the windows that terminal ..
to scroll down use the space bar ..
"less fileName" : has the same functionalities like man 
-> use the spacebar to nigate pages . 
-> you can search anything by using forward slash .. / and word.

# Searching specific thing inside a file .. e.g searching some information in a log file .
Using grep command will help achieve that 
"grep "word"  fileName"
